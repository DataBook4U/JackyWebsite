                Please read carefully what is and is not included in your Retreat package. Should you 
                have questions regarding the terms and conditions, we are available for consultation 
                and would be happy to clarify any areas in advance of signing a contract with us.

                <h2><strong>PAYMENT TERMS & CANCELLATIONS</strong></h2>

                <h1><strong>1. Retreat Pricing</strong></h1>
                <p>All prices are per person and are set well in advance of the Retreat start date. Prices
                include Retreat costs only; they do not include travel costs to and from the Retreat,
                except a pick-up and drop-off service from the port in Amorgos.
                </p>
                
                <h1><strong>2. Retreat Payment & Deposit</strong></h1>
                <p>Payment can be made by bank transfer. If a non-refundable deposit is made, the
                remaining balance will be due no later than 30 days prior to the Retreat start date.
                Participants will receive a reminder email one week prior to the due date. If full payment
                is not received by this deadline, we reserve the right to cancel your reservation and fill
                your spot. We will make every effort to avoid this situation by contacting you prior to

                Exceptions to our cancellation policy cannot be made for ANY reason, including
                weather, terrorism, civil unrest, health changes, personal emergencies or otherwise.
                There is no refund for arriving late or leaving a trip early. Please make sure to take out a
                travel insurance to cover for such cases.
